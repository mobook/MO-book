# 4. Network Optimization

In the previous chapters, we dealt with general problems by first formulating all necessary constraints and then passing the problem to an LO or MILO solver, but in a way we have been oblivious to the problem's structure. However, it is often advantageous to analyze this structure, as it can enable us to find better solution methods. In this chapter, we consider a very general class of problems with such a special structure -- the **network flow** problems.

This chapter includes several examples with companion Pyomo implementation that explore various modeling and implementation aspects of network optimization:

* [A dinner seating arrangement problem](dinner-seat-allocation.ipynb)
* [A franchise gasoline distribution problem](gasoline-distribution.ipynb)
* [A cryptocurrency arbitrage problem](cryptocurrency-arbitrage.ipynb)
* [Extra material: Energy dispatch problem](power-network.ipynb)
* [Extra material: Forex arbitrage](forex-arbitrage.ipynb)
