    "In contrast to the classical Markowitz portfolio, the MAD criterion requires a data set consisting of returns on the investment assets.

The MAD criterion produces portfolios with properties not shared by the Markowitz portfolio, including second degree stochastic dominance.\n",

Given mean return $r$ and the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ (i.e., $C$ such that $CC^T = \\Sigma$), we compute $r_t = r + C z_t$ where the elements of $z_t$ are zero mean normal variates with unit variance.\n",

    "Portfolio optimization refers to the process of allocating capital among a set of financial assets to achieve a desired tradeoff between risk and return. The classical Markowitz approach to this problem measures risk using the expected variance of the portfolio return. This criterion yields a quadratic program for the relative weights of assets in the optimal portfolio. \n",

Using MAD as the risk metric produces portfolios with several desirable properties not shared by the Markowitz portfolio, including [[w:Stochastic_dominance|second order stochastic dominance]].\n",

The relationship between risk and return is a fundamental principle of investment theory. \n",

    "This formulation doesn't place individual bounds on the weights $w_i$. In particular, $w_i < 0$ corresponds to short selling of the associated asset.  Constraints can be added if the investor imposes limits on short-selling, on the maximum amount that can be invested in a single asset, or other requirements for portfolio diversification.  Depending on the set of available investment opportunities, additional constraints can lead to infeasible investment problems."
