Decision variables are quantities that can be modified to achieve a desired outcome.  While some decision variables introduced at this stage may prove redundant later, the goal at this point is to create a comprehensive list of variables that will be useful in expressing the problem's objective and constraints. \n",

Here we have created expressions for revenue and cost that simplify the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision variables $y_U, y_V, x_M, x_A, x_B$ need to satisfy the specific conditions given in the problem statement. **Constraints** are mathematical relationships among decision variables or expressions,  formulated either as equalities or inequalities. In this problem, for each resource there is a linear constraint that limits overall production:\n",

    "In many textbooks, it is customary to list the decision variables under the $\\min$ symbol so as to clearly distinguish between the variables and any other parameters (which might also be expressed as symbols or letters) in the problem formulation. Throughout this book, however, we stick to the convention that the decision variables are only those which explicitly state their domains as part of the problem formulation.\n",

This is exactly where mathematical optimization algorithms come into play - they are generic procedures that can find the optimal solutions of problems as long as these problems can be formulated in a standardized fashion as above. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a practitioner, mathematical optimization often boils down to formulating the problem as a model above, then passing it over to one of the open-source or commercial software packages that can solve such a model regardless of what was the original *story* behind the model. To do so, we need an interface of communication between the models and the algorithms. In this book, we adopt a Python-based interface which is the ```Pyomo``` modeling package.\n",
