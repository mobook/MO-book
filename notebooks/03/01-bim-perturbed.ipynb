    "The company BIM realizes that a $1\\%$ fraction of the copper always gets wasted while producing both types of microchips, more specifically $1\\%$ of the required amount. This means that it actually takes $4.04$ gr of copper to produce a logic chip and $2.02$ gr of copper to produce a memory chip. If we rewrite the linear problem of [the basic BIM problem](../02/01-bim.ipynb) and modify accordingly the coefficients in the corresponding constraints, we obtain the following problem \n",

    "In terms of production, we want to manufacture an integer number of microchips, but it is not clear how to implement the fractional optimal solution $(x_1,x_2) \\approx (626.238,1123.762)$. Rounding down to $(x_1,x_2) = (626,1123)$ will intuitively yield a feasible solution, but this could lead to a minor loss of profit and/or an inefficient use of the available material. Rounding up to $(x_1,x_2) = (627,1124)$ could possibly lead to an unfeasible solution for which the available material is not enough. We could, of course, examine all the potential integer solutions by hand. However, if the problem had a more intricate structure or a greater number of decision variables, this would be much more difficult and may not lead to the true optimal solution.\n",
