    "## Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider again the [BIM raw material planning problem](../02/01-bim-rawmaterialplanning.ipynb) from Chapter 2 but with more sophisticated pricing and acquisition protocols. There are now three suppliers, each of which can deliver the following materials:\n",
    " - A: **silicon**, **germanium** and **plastic**\n",
    " - B: **copper**\n",
    " - C: all the above\n",
    " \n",
    "For the suppliers, the following conditions apply: copper should be acquired in multiples of 100 gram, since it is delivered in sheets of that weight. Unitary materials such as silicon, germanium and plastic may be acquired in any number, but the price is in batches of 100. Meaning that 30 units of silicon with 10 units of germanium and 50 units of plastic cost as much as 1 unit of silicon but half as much as 30 units of silicon with 30 units of germanium and 50 units of plastic. Furthermore, supplier C sells all materials and offers a discount if purchased together: 100 gram of copper and a batch of unitary material cost only 7. This set price is only applied to pairs, meaning that 100 gram of copper and 2 batches cost 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "The summary of the prices in $ is given in the following table:\n",

    "The holding price of copper is per 10 gram and the copper stocked is rounded up to multiples of 10 grams, meaning that 12 grams pay for 20. The capacity limitations of the warehouse allow for a maximum of $10$ kilograms of copper in stock at any moment, but there are no practical limitations to the number of units of unitary products in stock. The production is made-to-order, meaning that no inventory of chips is kept.\n",

    "## Optimization model\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, we need to start modeling by naming our decisions and identifying the relevant index sets. In the [previous BIM notebook](../02/bim-rawmaterialplanning.ipynb) we already had a set $T$ time periods (i.e., the months) and a set $P$ for the products. Since we want to keep track of how much we buy for which material and from which supplier, we need an additional index set $S$ for the suppliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous BIM notebook](../02/bim-rawmaterialplanning.ipynb) all decision variables were continuous, but now we also need to take care of a number of integer decision variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- number of batches of the unitary products;\n",
    "- number of copper sheets;\n",
    "- number of volume units in stock, since the inventory of copper pays per $10$ g;\n",
    "- number of copper sheet-batch of unitary product pairs acquired in the same month from supplier C, yielding discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above, we can clearly reuse the variables $s_{pt}$ from [previous BIM notebook](../02/bim-rawmaterialplanning.ipynb) to account for the total number of grams/units of each product. With respect to purchasing variables, however, we now need to keep track of unitary products and suppliers. For this reason, we introduce the integer variables $y_{ts}$ for the number of copper sheets purchased from supplier $s$, and continuous variables $x_{pts}$ for the number of units of unitary product $p$ purchased from supplier $s$. To translate these variables into `amounts of a product purchased regardless of the supplier', we introduce another variable $u_{pt}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, we introduce the variables that we use to account for the tricky integer quantities in our model. To account for the number of batches of unitary products at supplier $s$, we introduce integer variables $b_{ts}$, and, similarly, we introduce an integer variable $r_t$ for the number of 10 g copper batches in the inventory. Buying a copper sheet together with a batch of unitary products from supplier C is advantageous as we get a discount of $\\beta = 4 + 6 - 7$. For this reason, we introduce an extra integer variable $p_t$ to count the number of such pairs, so that $\\beta p_t$ describes the amount to the total discount acquired in month $t$. We need to include additional constraints to make sure that these three variables `take the values they should' in relation to the purchasing and inventory variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking all the above into account, we shall use the following decision variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $y_{ts}$: number of sheets of copper purchased in month $t$ from supplier $s$\n",
    "- $x_{pts}$: number of units of unitary product $p$ purchased in month $t$ from supplier $s$\n",
    "- $u_{pt}$: total number of units of product $p$ purchased in month $t$ (from all suppliers combined)\n",
    "- $b_{ts}$: number of batches of 100 unitary products purchased in month $t$ from supplier $s$\n",
    "- $p_{t}$: number of batch-copper sheet pairs purchased in month $t$ from supplier C \n",
    "- $r_t$: number of 10-unit amounts of copper (rounded up) in month $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by formulating the objective function using \\$ cents as unit. If we denote by $\\alpha_s$ the per-batch cost of unitary products at supplier $s$, then the total material acquisition cost is\n",
    "\n",

    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    \\sum_{t \\in T} \\Big( \\sum_{s \\in S} \\pi_{s} b_{ts} + \\alpha_{s} y_{ts} \\Big) - \\beta p_t \\Big),\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we count the acquisition costs for supplier $C$ as the total cost of the sheets of copper plus the batches of unitary materials minus the discount due to purchasing the pairs:\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to construct a system of constraints to ensure that the above costs are computed correctly. To transform the amounts of unitary materials purchased into batches of $100$, we construct the following constraints:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    s_{\\text{copper}, t} \\leq 10 r_t.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
