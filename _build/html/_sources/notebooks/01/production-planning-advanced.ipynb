In doing so, the modeler is making a choice to embed the external data representation directly into objectives and constraints of the problem.

Any change in data representation may require editing every place where that data is used in the model. By defining model parameters with `Param()`, the interface to the data representation is located in one clearly defined portion of a larger model, thereby significantly improving the long-term maintainabiity of models. This concern may be overkill in small models like we have here, but is a key consideration when constructing more complex applications.\n",

    "Some readers of these notebooks may be more experienced Python developers who wish to apply Pyomo in more specialized, data driven applications. The following cell shows how the Pyomo `ConcreteModel()` class can be extended by subclassing to create specialized model classes. Here we create a subclass called `ProductionModel` that accepts a particular representation of the problem data to produce a production model object. The production model object inherits all of the methods associated with any `ConcreteModel`, such as `.display()`, `.solve()`, and `.pprint()`, but can be extended with additional methods. "
