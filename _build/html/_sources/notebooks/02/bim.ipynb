    "A significant advantage of expressing problems in concise matrix form is not only a reduction in space but also the clarity it provides in revealing the similarities across problems from different domains. This uniformity allows also us to use a single tool (a solver) to solve all of them. Furthermore, when unnecessary details and equations are abstracted into a single matrix-vector expression, the theoretical analysis of linear optimization problems is streamlined, facilitating the exploration of the following key questions: \n",

    "- How do we prove the optimality of a solution?\n",

Once we commit to a specific canonical form, we can derive all sorts of useful results and properties, which will hold for all problems in the considered class anyway (because any problem can be transformed to a given form), without the need of considering cases like 'if the problem is a maximization then ..., and if it is a minimization then...'. \n",
