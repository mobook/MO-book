# 2. Linear Optimization

The simplest and most scalable type of optimization problem is the one where the objective function and constraints are formulated using the simplest possible type of functions -- linear functions. We refer to this class of problems as **linear optimization (LO)** problems.

In this collection of notebooks, we adhere to the standard convention of representing LO problems with an objective of minimization, all constraints being of the type $\geq$, and all variables being nonnegative. In other words, we work with the following general formulation for LO problems:

$$
\begin{align*}
    \min \quad & c^\top x \\
    \text{s.t.} \quad & A x \geq b\\
    & x \geq 0,
\end{align*}
$$

where the $n$ (decision) variables are grouped in a vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $c \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are the objective coefficients, and the $m$ linear constraints are described by the matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and the vector $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$. 

Linear problems can (i) be maximization problems, (ii) involve equality constraints and constraints of the form $\geq$, and (iii) have unbounded or non-positive decision variables $x_i$'s. In fact, any LO problem with such features can be easily converted to the "canonical" LO form above by adding/removing variables and/or multiplying specific inequalities by $-1$.

This chapter includes several with companion Pyomo implementation that explore various modeling and implementation aspects of LOs:
