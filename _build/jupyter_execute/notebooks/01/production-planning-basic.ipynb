    "# A Basic Pyomo Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyomo is an algebraic modeling language for mathematical optimization that is integrated within the Python programming environment. It enables users to create optimization models consisting of decision variables, expressions, objective functions, and constraints. Pyomo provides tools to transform models, and then solve them using a variety of open-source and commercial solvers. As an open-source project, Pyomo is not tied to any specific vendor, solver, or class of mathematical optimization problems, and is constantly evolving through contributions from third-party developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces basic elements of Pyomo common to most applications for the small [production planning problem](https://mobook.github.io/MO-book/notebooks/01/production-planning.html) introduced in a companion notebook:\n",

    "The Pyomo model shown below is a direct translation of the mathematical model into basic Pyomo components. In this approach, parameter values from the mathematical model are included directly in the Pyomo model for simplicity. This method works well for problems with a small number of decision variables and constraints, but it limits the reuse of the model. Another notebook will demonstrate Pyomo features for writing models for more generic, \"data-driven\" applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook also introduces the use of Python decorators to designate Pyomo expressions, objectives, and constraints. While decorators may be unfamiliar to some Python users, or even current Pyomo users, they offer a significant improvement in the readability of Pyomo model. This feature is relatively new and is available in recent versions of Pyomo."

    "This collection of notebooks is intended to be run in the cloud on [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) or on a personal computer. To meet this goal, We start each notebook by verifying the installation of Pyomo and an appropriate solver. When run on Google Colab, an installation of Pyomo and a solver must be done for each new Colab session. The [HiGHS solver](https://highs.dev/) is a high performance open source solver for linear and mixed integer optimization on Google Colab.  For a personal computer, we assume Python, Pyomo and the [Cbc solver](https://coin-or.github.io/Cbc/intro.html) have been previously installed. \n",
