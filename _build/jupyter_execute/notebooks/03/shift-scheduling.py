# ## Preamble: Install Pyomo and a solver
# 
# This cell selects and verifies a global SOLVER for the notebook.
# 
# If run on Google Colab, the cell installs Pyomo and HiGHS, then sets SOLVER to 
# use the Highs solver via the appsi module. If run elsewhere, it assumes Pyomo and CBC
# have been previously installed and sets SOLVER to use the CBC solver via the Pyomo 
# SolverFactory. It then verifies that SOLVER is available.

# ## Problem Statement
# 
# An article entitled ["Modeling and optimization of a weekly workforce with Python and Pyomo"](https://towardsdatascience.com/modeling-and-optimization-of-a-weekly-workforce-with-python-and-pyomo-29484ba065bb) by [Christian Carballo Lozano](https://medium.com/@ccarballolozano) posted on the [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) blog showed how to build a Pyomo model to schedule weekly shifts for a small campus food store. The article was primarily intended as a tutorial introduction to Pyomo (see the [github](https://github.com/ccarballolozano/blog-post-codes/blob/master/Modeling-and-optimization-of-a-weekly-workforce-with-Python-and-Pyomo/Modeling%20and%20optimization%20of%20a%20weekly%20workforce%20with%20Python%20and%20Pyomo.ipynb) repository for the code). 
# 
# From the original article:
# 
# > A new food store has been opened at the University Campus which will be open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Each day, there are three eight-hour shifts. Morning shift is from 6:00 to 14:00, evening shift is from 14:00 to 22:00 and night shift is from 22:00 to 6:00 of the next day.
# > During the night there is only one worker while during the day there are two, except on Sunday that there is only one for each shift. Each worker will not exceed a maximum of 40 hours per week and have to rest for 12 hours between two shifts.
# > As for the weekly rest days, an employee who rests one Sunday will also prefer to do the same that Saturday.
# In principle, there are available ten employees, which is clearly over-sized. The less the workers are needed, the more the resources for other stores.
# 
# Here we revisit the example with a new model demonstrating how to use of Pyomo decorators and of Pyomo sets, and how to use the model solution to create useful visualizations and reports for workers and managers.

# ## Model formulation

# ### Model sets
# 
# This problem requires assignment of an unspecified number of workers to a predetermined set of shifts. There are three shifts per day, seven days per week. These observations suggest the need for three ordered sets:
# 
# * `WORKERS` with $N$ elements representing workers. $N$ is as input to a function creating an instance of the model.
# 
# * `DAYS` with labeling the days of the week.
# 
# * `SHIFTS` labeling the shifts each day.
# 
# The problem describes additional considerations that suggest the utility of several additional sets.
# 
# * `SLOTS` is an ordered set of (day, shift) pairs describing all of the available shifts during the week. 
# 
# * `BLOCKS` is an ordered set of all overlapping 24 hour periods in the week. An element of the set contains the (day, shift) period in the corresponding period. This set will be used to limit worker assignments to no more than one for each 24 hour period.
# 
# * `WEEKENDS` is a the set of all (day, shift) pairs on a weekend. This set will be used to implement worker preferences on weekend scheduling.
# 
# These additional sets improve the readability of the model.
# 
# $$
# \begin{align*}
# \text{WORKERS} & = \{w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_1\} \text{ set of all workers} \\
# \text{DAYS} & = \{\text{Mon}, \text{Tues}, \ldots, \text{Sun}\} \text{ days of the week} \\
# \text{SHIFTS} & = \{\text{morning}, \text{evening}, \text{night}\} \text{ 8 hour daily shifts} \\
# \text{SLOTS} & = \text{DAYS} \times \text{SHIFTS} \text{ ordered set of all (day, shift) pairs}\\
# \text{BLOCKS} & \subset \text{SLOTS} \times \text{SLOTS} \times \text{SLOTS}  \text{ all 24 blocks of consecutive slots} \\
# \text{WEEKENDS} & \subset \text{SLOTS} \text{ subset of slots corresponding to weekends} \\
# \end{align*}
# $$

# ### Model parameters
# 
# $$
# \begin{align*}
# N & = \text{ number of workers} \\
# \text{WorkersRequired}_{d, s} & = \text{ number of workers required for each day, shift pair } (d, s) \\
# \end{align*}
# $$

# ### Model decision variables
# 
# $$
# \begin{align*}
# \text{assign}_{w, d, s} & = \begin{cases}1\quad\text{if worker } w \text{ is assigned to day, shift pair } (d,s)\in \text{SLOTS} \\ 0\quad \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \\
# \text{weekend}_{w} & = \begin{cases}1\quad\text{if worker } w \text{ is assigned to a weekend day, shift pair } (d,s)\in\text{WEEKENDS} \\ 0\quad \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \\
# \text{needed}_{w} & = \begin{cases}1\quad\text{if worker } w \text{ is needed during the week} \\ 0\quad \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \\
# \end{align*}
# $$

# ### Model constraints
# 
# Assign workers to each shift to meet staffing requirement.
# 
# $$\begin{align*}
# \\
# \sum_{w\in\text{ WORKERS}} \text{assign}_{w, d, s} & \geq \text{WorkersRequired}_{d, s} & \forall (d, s) \in \text{SLOTS} \\
# \end{align*}$$
# 
# Assign no more than 40 hours per week to each worker.
# 
# $$\begin{align*}
# \\
# 8\sum_{d,s\in\text{ SLOTS}} \text{assign}_{w, d, s} & \leq 40 & \forall w \in \text{WORKERS} \\
# \\
# \end{align*}$$
# 
# Assign no more than one shift in each 24 hour period.
# 
# $$\begin{align*}
# \\
# \text{assign}_{w, d_1,s_1} + \text{assign}_{w, d_2, s_2} + \text{assign}_{w, d_3, s_3} & \leq 1 & \forall w \in \text{WORKERS} \\ & & \forall ((d_1, s_1), (d_2, s_2), (d_3, s_3))\in \text{BLOCKS} \\
# \\
# \end{align*}$$
# 
# Do not assign any shift to a worker that is not needed during the week.
# 
# $$\begin{align*}
# \\
# \sum_{d,s\in\text{ SLOTS}} \text{assign}_{w,d,s} & \leq M_{\text{SLOTS}}\cdot\text{needed}_w & \forall w\in \text{WORKERS} \\
# \\
# \end{align*}$$
# 
# Do not assign any weekend shift to a worker that is not needed during the weekend.
# 
# $$\begin{align*}
# \\
# \sum_{d,s\in\text{ WEEKENDS}} \text{assign}_{w,d,s} & \leq M_{\text{WEEKENDS}}\cdot\text{weekend}_w & \forall w\in \text{WORKERS} \\
# \\
# \end{align*}$$

# ### Model objective
# 
# The model objective is to minimize the overall number of workers needed to fill the shift and work requirements while also attempting to meet worker preferences regarding weekend shift assignments. This is formulated here as an objective for minimizing a weighted sum of the number of workers needed to meet all shift requirements and the number of workers assigned to weekend shifts. The positive weight $\gamma$ determines the relative importance of these two measures of a desirable shift schedule.
# 
# $$
# \begin{align*}
# \min \left(\sum_{w\in\text{ WORKERS}} \text{needed}_w + \gamma\sum_{w\in\text{ WORKERS}} \text{weekend}_w)
# \right)\end{align*}
# $$

# ## Implementing the Schedule with Reports
# 
# Optimal planning models can generate large amounts of data that need to be summarized and communicated to individuals for implementation. 
# 
# ### Creating a master schedule with categorical data
# 
# The following cell creates a pandas DataFrame comprising all active assignments from the solved model. The data consists of all (worker, day, shift) tuples for which the binary decision variable m.assign equals one.    
# 
# The data is categorical consisting of a unique id for each worker, a day of the week, or the name of a shift. Each of the categories has a natural ordering that should be used in creating reports. This is implemented using the `CategoricalDtype` class.

# In[4]:


import pandas as pd

schedule = pd.DataFrame([[w, d, s] for w in m.WORKERS for d, s in m.SLOTS if m.assign[w, d, s]()], 
                        columns=["worker", "day", "shift"])

# create and assign a worker category type
worker_type = pd.CategoricalDtype(categories=m.WORKERS, ordered=True)
schedule["worker"] = schedule["worker"].astype(worker_type)

# create and assign a day category type
day_type = pd.CategoricalDtype(categories=m.DAYS, ordered=True)
schedule["day"] = schedule["day"].astype(day_type)

# create and assign a shift category type
shift_type = pd.CategoricalDtype(categories=m.SHIFTS, ordered=True)
schedule["shift"] = schedule["shift"].astype(shift_type)

# demonstrate sorting and display of the master schedule
schedule.sort_values(by=["day", "shift", "worker"])


# ### Reports for workers
# 
# Each worker should receive a report detailing their shift assignments. The reports are created by sorting the master schedule by worker, day, and shift, then grouping by worker. 

# In[5]:


# sort schedule by worker
schedule = schedule.sort_values(by=["worker", "day", "shift"])

# print worker schedules
for worker, worker_schedule in schedule.groupby('worker'):
    print(f"\n Work schedule for {worker}")
    if len(worker_schedule) > 0:   
        for s in worker_schedule.to_string(index=False).split('\n'):
            print(s)
    else:
        print("   no assigned shifts")


# ### Reports for store managers
# 
# The store managers need reports listing workers by assigned day and shift.

# In[6]:


# sort by day, shift, worker
schedule = schedule.sort_values(by=["day", "shift", "worker"])

for day, day_schedule in schedule.groupby("day"):
    print(f"\nShift schedule for {day}")
    for shift, shift_schedule in day_schedule.groupby("shift"):
        print(f"   {shift} shift: ", end="")
        print(', '.join([worker for worker in shift_schedule["worker"].values]))


# ## Suggested Exercises
# 
# 1. How many workers will be required to operate the food store if all workers are limited to four shifts per week, i.e., 32 hours?  How about 3 shifts or 24 hours per week?
# 
# 2. Add a second class of workers called "manager".  There needs to be one manager on duty for every shift, that morning shifts require 3 staff on duty, evening shifts 2,
# and night shifts 1.
# 
# 3. Add a third class of workers called "part_time". Part time workers are limited to no more than 30 hours per week.
# 
# 4. Modify the problem formulation and objective to spread the shifts out amongst all workers, attempting to equalize the total number of assigned shifts, and similar numbers of day, evening, night, and weekend shifts.
# 
# 5. Find the minimum cost staffing plan assuming managers cost 30 euros per hour + 100 euros per week in fixed benefits, regular workers cost 20 euros per hour plus 80 euros per week in fixed benefits, and part time workers cost 15 euros per week with no benefits.
