    "This problem is relatively small, featuring only $n=2$ decision variables and $m=4$ constraints. However, it is easy to imagine that adding more products and constraints would significantly complicate matters. In such cases, explicitly listing each constraint and fully expanding all expressions could obfuscate the overall structure, making it challenging to discern the key aspects of the problem. In fact, it is much more common to formulate, analyze, and compare linear optimization problems using vectors and matrices. This format not only aligns more closely with computational implementation, but also greatly facilitates the identification of the similarities between various LO problems, regardless of whether they are about chip production or food manufacturing.\n",

This uniformity allows also us to use a single tool (a solver) to solve all of them. Furthermore, when unnecessary details and equations are abstracted into a single matrix-vector expression, the theoretical analysis of linear optimization problems is streamlined, facilitating the exploration of the following key questions: \n",

Once we commit to a specific canonical form, we can derive all sorts of useful results and properties, which will hold for all problems in the considered class anyway (because any problem can be transformed to a given form), without the need of considering cases like 'if the problem is a maximization then ..., and if it is a minimization then...'. \n",
