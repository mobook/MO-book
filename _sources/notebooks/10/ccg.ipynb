    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider again the production planning example from [Chapter 1](../01/01.00.md) where a small startup company has announced the initial production of two models, $U$ and $V$. For completeness we first recall the problem setting and then introduce the additional layer of uncertainty:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model $U$ is the higher-priced version requiring 10 units of raw material. The labor requirement is estimated to be 1 hour of labor A and 2 hours of labor B. The $U$ model will sell for 270€ per unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model $V$ requires 9 units of the same raw materials and is estimated to require 1 hour of labor A and 1 hour of labor B. Model $V$ sells for 210€ per unit with unlimited demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A pre-production  marketing campaign offers guaranteed delivery of model $U$ in return for a down payment. Initially it is expected that the number of such orders will be 20 units. Because of the higher price, the demand for model $U$ is limited so no more than 40 units will be produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The raw materials cost 10€ per unit. The raw materials have a long lead time and must be ordered now. Unused raw materials have no waste value. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Given current staffing, there are 80 hours of labor A available at a cost of 50€/hour, and 100 hours of labor B available at a cost of 40€/hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The company will not have not accurate knowledge of the labor required to produce each product until production starts. The estimated amount of labor A and labor B needed for each unit produced could be off by 15% and 25%, respectively. Additionally, there is uncertainty about the amount of down-payment demand for model $U$ -- it can differ by up to 25%, up or down, from the nominal value of 20. It is not expected, however, that more than two of those parameters are perturbed by their maximum amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company's chief operating officer (COO) must decide how much raw material to order now without complete information about the labor needed to manufacture the models or knowledge about the outcome of the pre-production marketing campaign. If the COO orders too much now then raw material will be left over and wasted. If the COO orders too little then a profit opportunity will be lost. In either case, the profit realized will be less than the potential. In what way can the best decision be made?"

This comes, however, at the expense of having a worse performance in an 'average' scenario. You can expect to observe this kind of phenomenon very often whenever you need to solve a problem under uncertainty and are unsure whether the worst-case or average-case performance should be optimized for. The degree of tradeoff can help you then make the right decision."

The reason for doing this is to (possibly) accelerate the CCG convergence - the profit constraint will be taken care of anyway as the variable $y_3$ can adapt freely for each newly generated $z^i$ and each newly generated solution to the master problem, and at the same time, we eliminate the risk of iteratively building a list of scenarios $z$ that violate only the profit constraints across all $i$, without actually hurting the feasibility of the production plans made."
